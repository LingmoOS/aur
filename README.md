Lingmo packages on AUR. These PKGBUILDs will periodically upload to AUR after testing.

We provide prebuilt packages repository:
```conf
[lingmo]
Server = https://lingmoos.github.io/aur/$arch
SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly
```
However, GPG signing is not available, use at your own risk or built them manually from AUR.
